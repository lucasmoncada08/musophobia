# Project Goal

I want to be able to create an edge browser extension that will function like my own personal vimium c. 

I would like to implement the features in the following order of priority:
- smooth scrolling 
- get the basic f functionality and smooth scrolling
- single letter commands (r, t), search + nav to tab
- tab management; search through tabs and go through the tabs
